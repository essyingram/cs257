User stories
Story 1:
User Story:
As a Harry Potter fan, I want to look up a character and see their house, role, blood status, etc so that I can learn more about their background.
Implementation Idea:
Search bar with autocomplete for characters. Clicking a name opens a detail page displaying all available attributes.
Story 2:
User Story:
As someone with an interest in magic, I want to search for spells by type (e.g., charm, curse) or effect (e.g., light-producing) so that I can learn new incantations.
Implementation Idea:
A filterable list of spells with dropdowns for type and effect. Each entry links to a detailed spell description page.
Story 3:
User Story:
As a potion enthusiast ( really, I loved apothecary diaries), I want to browse all potions and learn about their ingredients and effects so that I can "study" potion-making.
Implementation Idea:
A searchable potion list with tags (e.g difficulty, magical properties). Selecting a potion reveals detailed info, including side effects.
Story 4:
User Story:
As a researcher, I want to compare characters and see if their spells or potions overlap or relate so that I can explore interesting connections in the story.
Implementation Idea:
An optional combined view that allows users to select a character and see related spells/potions (even just side-by-side if no direct links exist).
