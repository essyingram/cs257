OUR DATA: Our datasets contain comprehensive information about characters, potions and spells featured in the Harry Potter franchise. A few categories of data included for HP characters are name, gender, occupation, wand type, and even patronus. The potion data includes names, qualitative traits, effects and ingredients for each potion. The spell data also includes helpful characteristics like incantation name, commonly used names and type (e.g., hex, jinx, charm, etc.).

User stories
Story 1:
User Story:
As a Harry Potter fan, I want to look up a character and see their house, role, blood status, etc so that I can learn more about their background.
Implementation Idea:
Search bar with autocomplete for characters. Clicking a name opens a detail page displaying all available attributes.
Story 2:
User Story:
As someone with an interest in magic, I want to search for spells by type (e.g., charm, curse) or effect (e.g., light-producing) so that I can learn new incantations.
Implementation Idea:
A filterable list of spells with dropdowns for type and effect. Each entry links to a detailed spell description page.
Story 3:
User Story:
As a potion enthusiast ( really, I loved apothecary diaries), I want to browse all potions and learn about their ingredients and effects so that I can "study" potion-making.
Implementation Idea:
A searchable potion list with tags (e.g difficulty, magical properties). Selecting a potion reveals detailed info, including side effects.
Story 4:
User Story:
 As a researcher, I want to compare characters and see if their spells or potions overlap or relate so that I can explore interesting connections in the story.
Implementation Idea:
An optional combined view that allows users to select a character and see related spells/potions (even just side-by-side if no direct links exist).
