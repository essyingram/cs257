User Testing Observations
30 May 2025

Things the testers found easy
- search for characters, spells and potions whose names contain the search string

Things people had trouble with
- given a list of items, everyone was unable to click 
    to get the detailed specs about a specific item (because this feauture is buggy)

Other positive comments or observations
- Bare-bones look but easy to use.

Other suggestions for improvement
- The app is currently not functional. While the search can populate the correct 
    information from my database, I'm still having trouble with allowing the user 
    to click on a particular search item and view the Specs Card. 

Other notes [if any didn't fit the other categories]
- I'm working hard on debugging my codeâ€”I can upload a functional 'firstdraft' app
    once the specs are working!
