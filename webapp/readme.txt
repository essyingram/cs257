STATUS: 
    What works: Everythingâ€”this web application allows users to search the tables of data for dictionaries whose names contain the search-string.
The user may also the select character, spell, and or potion categories to customize their search results.
For example, if a user checks no boxes (or all of them) before entering a search string and clicking search, all three tables of data will be searched.
Additionally, after search results populate, the user may select an item in the list of matches to view its specifications to the right of the results list.
The current specs will clear if a new search is issued.

NOTES: Thanks for a great term. Have a wonderful summer.
